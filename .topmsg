Subject: [PATCH] t/shared-library-support

Enabling shared library support is a tricky business. Building libraries with
--enable-shared is simple enough, but Cabal doesn't take advantage of shared
libraries when linking executables (even when --enable-shared is specified). If
it would, then that would also require further changes to the pkgbuild
generator, because the dependencies would have to be *run-time* dependencies
rather than build-time dependencies, what they are now.
