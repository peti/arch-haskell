Subject: [PATCH] t/drop-obsolete-comment-about-provides

Our PKGBUILD files feature a comment saying that we provide all package
dependencies and that the user's front-end to pacman must understand
'provides'. In fact, this is not true: we no longer specify dependencies
on packages that are provided by GHC. IMHO, this comment ought to be
removed because it's inaccurate.
