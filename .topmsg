Subject: [PATCH] t/generalize-cabal2pkg

The current version of cabal2pkg decides about the name of the generated
ArchLinux package. This decision, however, should to the taken by the user of
the function, i.e. the desired package name ought to be passed as a parameter.
The same applies to the value of $pkgrel, which is currently hard-coded to "1".
