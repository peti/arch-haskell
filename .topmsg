Subject: drop obsolete comment about 'provides' field

Our PKGBUILD files feature a comment saying that we provide all package
dependencies and that the user's front-end to pacman must understand
'provides'. In fact, this is not true: we no longer specify dependencies
on packages that are provided by GHC. Instead of that comment, I feel we
should provide a Maintainer: field, which -- according to namcap -- is
currently missing.
