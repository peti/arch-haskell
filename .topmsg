Subject: [PATCH] Combine the separate arch-haskell repositories into a coherent build.

ArchHaskell development is spread out over a whole lot of different
repositories. That makes it hard to develop those tools, because
there are so many separate components involved. The master branch of
this repository combines all releavent repositories into one.
